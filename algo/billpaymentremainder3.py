'''This code uses the schedule library to schedule reminders
 three days before the debt due date and alerts for available funds every week.
  The plyer library is used to send notifications. Please note that this is a simple example,
   and in a real-world scenario, you might need to integrate this code with a database or an API
   to fetch actual customer data and due dates.'''
